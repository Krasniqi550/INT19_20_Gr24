				<h2> Tesla Model 3 </h2>
				<p>It even comes with the Autopilot drive assistance system, which takes the edge off long trips and adds to the space-age feel. A dual-motor version with all-wheel drive and increased range is available as well; it can cover a claimed 329 miles and serves up a supercar-rivalling 0-60mph time of 3.2sec.</p>

				<h2> MG ZS EV </h2>
				<p> Case in point: MG has just launched its first all-electric car, the ZS EV, and the first thousand customers will benefit from an introductory price of £21,495. Even once that offer has expired, the price – inclusive of the government grant – is a still-reasonable, comparatively speaking, £24,995.  </p>

				<h2> Audi e-Tron </h2>
				<p> The first full series-production electric car from Audi is a triumph: you get the usual Ingolstadt quality and driving manners, all wrapped up in a very practical SUV bodystyle that's akin to a Q5 crossover. Performance is rapid, range decent and it just all feels so normal.  </p>

				<h2> Mercedes-Benz EQC  </h2>
				<p> The EQC is the first car in Mercedes' new EV-only 'EQ' range and, while not exactly innovative, it's an unquestionably capable SUV. It has a range of 259 miles, features twin motors for all-wheel drive, can sprint from 0-62mph in 5.1sec and is loaded with technology; it also offers seating for five and a large boot – as you'd hope, considering its size and hefty 2425kg kerb weight.  </p>

				<h2> Jaguar i-Pace  </h2>
				<p> Jaguar's first all-electric car, is a tremendously slick affair – and one that's a tempting alternative to established rivals such as the Tesla Model X. </p>
