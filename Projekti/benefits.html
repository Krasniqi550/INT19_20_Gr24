	<p class="aboutright"><strong>HOW DO ELETRIC CARS WORK?</strong><br>Electric cars function by plugging into a charge point and taking electricity from the grid.<br>
	They store the electricity in rechargeable batteries that power an electric motor, which turns the wheels.
<br>Electric cars accelerate faster than vehicles with traditional fuel engines – so they feel lighter to drive.
<br><strong>HOW DOES CHARGING WORK?</strong><br>
You can charge an electric vehicle by plugging it into a public charging station or into a home charging unit.<br>
 There's plenty of charging stations around the UK to stay fully charged while you're out and about.<br>
 But to get the best deal for home charging, it's important to get the right electricity tariff, so you can spend less money charging and save more on your bill.

		<tr>
		<td class="titujt"> <strong> Cheaper to run </strong></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="nentitujt"> Owners of an EV have the advantage of much lower running costs. 
			The electricity to charge an EV works out around a third as much
			 per kilometre as buying petrol for the same vehicle1.
		There are a number of handy calculators you can use to see the savings.
		 Check out the Fuel Cost Savings Calculator on the My Electric Car website. </td></tr>
		<tr>
		<td class="titujt"> <strong>Cheaper to maintain </strong></td> </tr>
		<tr>
		<td class="nentitujt"> A battery electric vehicle (BEV) has a lot less moving parts than a conventional petrol/diesel car. There is relatively little servicing and no expensive exhaust systems,
		 starter motors, fuel injection systems, radiators and many other parts
		  that aren’t needed in an EV.</td></tr>
		<tr>
		<td class="titujt"> <strong>Other savings </strong></td></tr>
		<tr>
		<td class="nentitujt"> Some Australian states offer other savings for EV owners. 
		EVs registered in the ACT are exempt from stamp-duty.
		 EVs registered in Victoria receive a $100 reduction in registration fees each year4. </td></tr>
		<tr>
		<td class="titujt"> <strong> Better for the environment </strong></td></tr>
		<tr>
		<td class="nentitujt"> Less pollution: By choosing to drive an EV you are 
			helping to reduce harmful air pollution from exhaust 
			emissions. An EV has zero exhaust emissions5.
		Renewable energy: If you use renewable energy to recharge your 
	EV, you can reduce your greenhouse gas emissions even further. 
	 You could recharge your EV from your solar PV system during the 
	day instead of from the grid.  Another idea is to purchase GreenPower
	 from your electricity retailer. Then, even if you recharge your EV 
	from the grid, your greenhouse gas emissions are reduced.</td>
</tr>
<td class="titujt"> <strong> Health benefits </strong></td></tr>
<tr>
	<td class="nentitujt"> Reduced harmful exhaust emissions is good news for our health. Better air quality will lead to less health problems and costs caused by air pollution. EVs are also quieter than petrol/diesel vehicles, which means less noise pollution. </td></tr>
	<td class="titujt"> <strong> Safety improvements </strong></td>
	<tr>
		<td class="nentitujt"> Recent findings have shown that several EV features can improve safety. EVs tend to have a lower centre of gravity that makes them less likely to roll over. They can also have a lower risk for major fires or explosions and the body construction and durability of EVs may make them safer in a collision. </td></tr> </table>
